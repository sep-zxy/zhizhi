You are an expert code reviewer identifying common misconceptions.

Given these concepts found in a code diff:
{concept_terms}

Run ID:
{run_id}

And this code change:
```
{diff_summary}
```

Identify common misconceptions that developers might have about these concepts. For each misconception:
1. State the misconception clearly
2. Provide the correct understanding
3. Reference the specific code evidence (file:line format)
4. Rate severity: low (style/naming), medium (logic/design), high (security/correctness)
5. Add safety tags if applicable: security, memory_safety, type_confusion, race_condition, injection, overflow

{OUTPUT_LANGUAGE}

If the input includes a run identifier, include it as `run_id` on each object.

Respond with a JSON object with a `cards` array. Each card object must include keys: concept, misconception, correction, evidence_ref, severity, safety_tags, run_id
